     *
     * You can display in any of a variety of ways, but we should see
     * a tree that we can identify left and right children of each node
     *
     * For example: 
     
       |       |-------50
       |-------40
       |       |-------35
       30
       |-------20
       |       |-------10
       
       Look from bottom to top. Inorder traversal of above tree (10,20,30,35,40,50)
       
       Or, you can display a tree of this kind.
       
           30
           /\
          /  \
         20  40
         /   /\
        /   /  \
       10  35  50 

       Or, you can come up with your own orientation pattern, like this.

       10                 
               20
                       30
       35                
               40
       50                  

       The connecting lines are not required if we can interpret your tree.
